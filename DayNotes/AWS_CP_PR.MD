# AWS Cloud Practitioner Practice
1. Configure how to set budgets in the billing dashboard  
	Budgets can be made either on the basis of usage or cost. We can set the minimum threshold value of the total amount incurred.  
	It can also set budgets on the bas of RI utlizations  which can track any under or over utlizations.
	Once set we can configure billing alarms whenever there is a breach in the threshold set.Once it is set we can have a notfication sent to our configured email.
2. IAM : [*Identity and Access Management*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/)   
   You must create a separate account for yourself use that instead of the root account. It is  best practice to create a user attached to a group.
   Refer the below snapshot to see how to create a user and the group.
